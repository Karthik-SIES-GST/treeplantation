            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

            <p> Azadirachta indica, commonly known as neem, nimtree or Indian lilac, is a tree in the mahogany family
                Meliaceae. It is one of two species in the genus Azadirachta, and is native to the Indian subcontinent.
                It is typically grown in tropical and semi-tropical regions. Neem trees also grow in islands located in
                the southern part of Iran.

            <h1>HOW TO GROW</h1>
            <p>
                Neem is a hardy tree that can tolerate temperatures up to 120 F. (50 C.). However, extended cool weather
                with temperatures below 35 F. (5 C.) will cause the tree to drop its leaves. The tree won’t tolerate
                colder temperatures, wet climates or prolonged drought.

                plant fresh neem seeds directly in the ground, or start them in trays or pots and transplant them
                outdoors at about three months. If you have access to mature trees, you can root the cuttings in late
                fall or early winter.

            <h1>IDEAL CLIMATE</h1>
            <p>
                The Neem has adapted to a wide range of climates. It thrives well in hot weather, where the maximum
                shade temperature is as high as 49° C and tolerates cold upto 0° C on altitudes upto 1500 m.

                Neem is a fast-growing tree that can reach a height of 15–20 metres (49–66 ft), and rarely 35–40 metres
                (115–131 ft). It is evergreen, but in severe drought it may shed most or nearly all of its leaves. The
                branches are wide and spreading. The fairly dense crown is roundish and may reach a diameter of 20–25
                metres (66–82 ft).

            <p>
                Neem tree needs little water and plenty of sunlight. The tree grows naturally in areas where the
                rainfall is in the range of 450 to 1200 mm. However, it has been introduced successfully even in areas
                where the rainfall is as low as 200 – 250 mm. It cannot withstand water-logged areas and poorly drained
                soils.

            <h1>REQUIRMENTS</h1>
            <p>
                Neem trees require plenty of bright sunlight. The trees benefit from regular moisture, but be careful
                not to overwater, as the tree won’t tolerate wet feet or poorly drained soil. Allow the soil to dry
                between every watering.Feed the tree about once a month in spring and summer, using a light application
                of any good quality, balanced fertilizer or a dilute solution of water-soluble fertilizer. You can also
                apply a diluted fish emulsion.

            <h1>USES</h1>
            <p>
                Neem oil has been a trusted remedy for a naturally healthy skin in the villages of India. Derived from
                the seeds of the neem tree it contains all the disinfecting and healing properties of the tree, in a
                concentrated easily usable form. For centuries, this therapeutic oil has provided protection and

                Scientific studies have shown that Neem contains certain chemicals, which are unique. The primary
                chemicals are a mixture of 3-4 related compounds called limonoids. Neem seeds also contain a few
                chemicals that have sulphur. These phyto-chemicals add the characteristic smell to the neem oil. They
                also attach additional curative properties to the oil. It has a dark yellow color, turns solid at
                temperatures below twenty-three degrees Celsius, and does not dry out. The oil is composed mainly of
                glycerides of palmitin, stearin, oil and linol acids. It chemically resembles soy oil or olive oil. In
                the cold-pressed oil, there are also 10 to 20 percent of the total content of biologically active
                components, especially the limonoids. Bitter components contained in neem oil and certain sulfur
                compounds that give the oil its strong garlic scent, destroy the taste.

                It is a completely natural total first aid tool for families. Due to its unique composition it has an
                almost magical effect on chronic skin conditions that fail to respond to conventional treatments. What
                makes neem oil outstanding in comparison to other remedies is that it is active against all three
                varieties of infectious organisms: Bacteria, Fungii and Viruses. The oil is known to provide a very
                effective germicidal action. Modern science has now confirmed the effectiveness of Neem oil in fighting
                infection. Scientific studies indicate that Neem has very powerful skin rejuvenating qualities and it is
                being hailed as the Oil of Wonder.

                Many strains of bacteria are found to be resistant to the modern antibiotics. Neem oil has a seemingly
                endless range of antibacterial uses. This has prompted the development of neem as an anti-bacterial drug
                for these resistant strains, against which it has shown promising activity in the laboratory tests.
                Because of its antiseptic qualities, neem oil is also well suited for medicinal soaps and
                pharmaceuticals such as salves and creams. Neem oil is used in cosmetics for creams, lotions and
                shampoos.

                It has a wide spectrum of action and can be safely used for a variety of skin conditions. Neem oil and
                many of its constituents have been successfully used against a wide range of bacteria, viruses, fungi
                and parasites. Neem oil has been reported to be effective against certain human fungi, which are even
                difficult to control, by modern synthetic fungicides. These include some Trichophyton, Epidermophyton,
                Microsporum, Trichosporon, Geotricum and Candida. Neem oil inhibited the growth of all the three strains
                of Mycobacterium in a concentration of 12.5 mg/ml.

                Neem oil has consistently shown moderate to potent anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of Gram
                positive and Gram negative microorganism. The oil possess marked spectrum of anti-bacterial activity
                against Gram negative and positive microorganisms including M. tuberculosis, streptomycin resistant
                strain. Neem oil absorbs quickly into the skin and has good skin penetration. It’s compounds are
                non-irritating and are known to have a minimum of allergic reactions. It is neither too hot (ushna) nor
                too cold (sheetha) in potency (veerya) and subsides pitta and kapha dosha, promoting holistic health for
                mind, body and spirit.
                Apart from its suitability to provide shade and for Afforestation the wood of the neem tree is very much
                in demand. The trunk and branches are ideal for building being both strong and rather resistant to
                termites. It is also used for firewood and in the making of charcoal.
