                   The Jamun trees can be grown on a wide range of soils - calcareous, saline sodic soils and marshy areas.<br>
Deep loam and well-drained soils are, however, the most ideal.<br>
It does not like very heavy and light sandy soils.

                    Jamun is a hardy fruit, it can be grown under adverse soil and climate conditions.<br>
                    It thrives well under both tropical and subtropical climates.<br>
                    It requires dry weather at the time of flowering and fruit setting.<br>
                    Early rains are beneficial for better growth, development and ripening of fruit.<br>
                    Young plants are susceptible to frost.

                <p>
                    The seedling Jamun trees start bearing after 9 to 10 years of planting.<br>
                    Grafted or Budded trees start bearing in 5 to 7 years.<br>
                    The Jamun plant can bear  for the life span of 60 years.<br> Generally Jamun fruits come to the ripening stage in June-July.<br>
                    After full bloom, It takes about 4 to 5 months to ripen the fruits.

                <p>
                    Seedling Jamun trees start bearing fruits @ age of 8 – 10 years while budded and grafted trees  start bearing in 6 – 7 years.<br>
                    In the Pre-bearing stage, about 30 kg of well rotten farmyard manure (F.M.Y) (or) compost per plant per year should be applied.<br>
                    For bearing Jamun trees,  about 70 kg of F.M.Y per plant and per year should be applied.<br>
                    Organic manures should be applied just a month before flowering starts.<br>
                    Other in-organic fertilizers like 500 kg of “N”,600 grams & 300 grams of “K”/plant/year should be applied.<br>
                    This should be applied near the canopy of the tree & mixed in field soil by hoeing.<br>

                <p>
                    Young Jamun plants in early stages require frequent watering but subsequently, irrigations should be reduced, initial stages of plants require about 12 irrigation per year (monthly once).<br>
                    Mature trees require once in 2 months in a year, this is important at the fruit ripening stage, occasional irrigation may be carried out when the soil becomes dry and to keep the soil in moist condition.
