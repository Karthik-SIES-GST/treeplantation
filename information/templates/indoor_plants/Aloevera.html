      Aloe vera is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe. An evergreen perennial, it originates from the Arabian
      Peninsula, but grows wild in tropical, semi-tropical, and arid climates around the world. It is cultivated for

      as a potted plant.

    <h2></h2>
    <p>
    <h2><u>Climate:</u></h2>
    The Aloe species are often thought to grow only in warm and dry climates. In fact, however, Aloe vera and
    many other Aloe species can grow and grow in a variety of climatic environments. These include both desert and
    alpine sites. However, a suitable climate for Aloe to become efficient crops is that of tropical and subtropical
    regions.
    <br>
    <h2><u>Soil:</u></h2>
    All members of the Aloe genus require sandy or gravelly soil with very good drainage to reduce the risk of
    root rot and nutritional deficiencies. When planted in containers, aloe vera plants do well in a mixture of
    commercial potting mix with extra sand, granite grit or perlite added.
    This plant naturally occurs in extremely dry and poor soils. It will grow well in many different types of soil,
    from sandy to moderately fertile loam, as long as it has good drainage. To increase drainage at your planting
    site, build a mound before planting the aloe, incorporating organic compost into the soil.
    <br>
    <h2><u>Water:</u></h2>
    Water the soil on all parts of the pot until you can see water coming out of the draining holes. All the
    water that pools in the saucer should be emptied and the plant should not be allowed to sit in water.
    water whenever the soil is dry during the summer season. Water infrequently during cold season.
    <br>
    <h1><u>Sunlight:</u></h1>
    aloe vera plant prefer 8-10 hrs of sunlight a day
    <br>
    <h2><u>Fertilizer:</u></h2>
    fertilize once a year or never aloe plants do not require fertilizer,and overuse can harm then plant

        STEPS FOR PROPAGATION OF NEW ALOE PLANT
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section class="section section-dark" id="propagation">
    <h2></h2>
    <p>
      The aloe plant cannot be grown from a leaf cutting, and instead is typically propagated by detaching younger clone
      plants from the base of the adult plant or from the joint root system.<br>
      <br>
      1)Let your adult aloe plant grow to fill its container. While any healthy aloe plant has a chance to produce
        younger plants, or "pups", this is most likely to happen when the adult plant has reached the boundaries of its
        container.<br>
      <br>
      2)Wait until young plants emerge. Your Aloe vera plant should start to produce "pups", which are clones of itself
      that share some of the mother plant's root system and may be attached to the base as well.<br>
      <br>
      3)Let the young plants grow to sufficient size. The young plants will do best if you wait until they are a little
      larger and mature enough to have a few roots of their own (at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) tall, and preferably 5
      inches (12.5 cm).)<br>
      <br>
      4) Use a sharp, clean knife to remove the young plant. Clear away the dirt at the base of the pup to see whether
      it is attached to the mother plant. If it is, cut it away, making sure to keep the young plant attached to its
      roots if any are present.<br>
      <br>
      5) Leave cut plants in the air for a couple days. Instead of planting the new aloe immediately, you may wish to
      allow the plant to form a callus over the knife cut.
      <br>
      6)Plant in its own container and support. Place the young plant on top of well-draining soil, without burying the
      leaves.<br>
      <br>
      7)Mist once every few days if the plant has no roots. Before the roots have grown in, do not water the plant.<br>
      <br>
      8)Water sparingly after roots set in.<br>
      <br>

  <section class="section section-dark" id="taking_care">
    <h2></h2>
    <p>
      1)Give the plant adequate sunlight and warmth. Aloe vera plants prefer 8â€“10 hours of sunlight a day. While they
      grow best in warm or hot temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      2)Water whenever the soil is dry during the summer season.<br>
      <br>
      3)Water infrequently during the cold season.<br>
      <br>
      4)Fertilize once a year or never. Aloe plants do not require fertilizer, and overuse can harm the plant or cause
      it to grow in an unhealthy manner.<br>
      <br>
      5)Clear weeds carefully. The soil around the aloe plant should be free of grass and weeds.<br>
      <br>
      6)Increase sunlight if the leaves look flat and low.<br>
      <br>
      7)Decrease sunlight if the leaves turn brown.<br>
      <br>
      8)Increase water if the leaves look thin/curled.<br>
      <br>
      9)Stop watering if the leaves turn yellow or fall apart.<br>
