                <p>
                     1) Plant tomatoes in loose, well-drained soil.  
                        But almost any garden soil will grow tomatoes.
                     2) Sandy loam is best for early tomatoes.
                     3) Heavy clay loam is ideal for late tomatoes.
                     4) Amend the soil with aged compost or
                        commercial organic planting mix before planting.
                     5) Tomatoes prefer a soil with a pH between 6.0 
                        and 7.0, just below neutral in acidity.

                <p>
                     1)Tomatoes require a minimum of 8 hours of continuous sunlight each day. More is better.
                     2)Tomato seedlings in garden:
                       Set 8 to 10-week old tomato seedlings in the garden two weeks after the last frost in spring.

                <p>
                     Tomatoes need 3 to 4 months of warm, clear, fairly dry weather to produce best.
                     Set 8 to 10-week old tomato seedlings in the garden two weeks after the last frost in spring. If transplanted sooner, tomatoes must be protected from cold temperatures with hot caps or plastic tunnels.
                     Tomatoes need consistent night temperatures between 55°F(12.7°C) and 75°F(24°C) to set fruit. (A few varieties will set fruit at lower or higher temperatures.)
                     Later in the season, the fruit will not color properly when night temperatures stay above 85°F, and plants will quit growing when temperatures go above 95°F(35°C).
                     Where summer temperatures exceed 95°F, shade cloth protection will protect leaves and fruit.

                <p>
                    Tomato is an annual plant but it lives upto 6-7 months as it is prone to parasites.

                <p>
                    Leaves may also be used to make lemon grass tea.<br>The essential oil extracted from the leaves is commonly used in insect repellents, perfumes and soaps.<br>
                    Lemongrass is also a delicious addition to soups, stews, stir frys,salads, curries, vegetables, rice, marinades and beverages

                <p>
                    Tomatoes are the major dietary source of the antioxidant lycopene, which has been linked to many health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and cancer. They are also a great source of vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K

                <p>
                     1)Prepare the tomato-growing bed with well-rotted garden compost and a trowelful of aged manure added to the soil where each plant will grow.
                     2)Add a trowelful of bone meal into the bottom of each hole–the extra phosphorus will speed ripening.
                     3)Too much nitrogen will give you abundant foliage but delay ripening.
                     4)Sprinkle additional nitrogen around each plant when the top leaves turn yellow or the stem turns deep purple.

                <p>
                     1)Keep the soil evenly moist–not too wet and not too dry. 
                     2)Too much water will drown the plants; too little water will stop fruit production.
                     3)Test soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil–if it comes out dry, it’s time to water; if it comes out wet, hold off.
                     4)During periods of drought deep-water tomatoes once a week and slow soil moisture evaporation by mulching with aged compost or straw.
                     5)A constant, even supply of water can prevent blossom end rot, but too much water will cause it.
