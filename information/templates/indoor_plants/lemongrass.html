                <p>
                     If you’re planting lemongrass in a pot, use well-draining potting soil .
                     Lemongrass plants prefer rich, loamy soil.
                     You can create this ideal soil by adding several different soil amendments: compost, manure, and leaf mold are all enriching additives that you can add at planting time.

                <p>
                    Lemongrass, in its native habitat, enjoys long and hot growing seasons and will grow best in areas that can replicate these conditions.<br>
                    As the plant does not like to get too cold, make sure you don’t keep it near drafty areas, such as entryways, cooling vents, or open windows.<br>
                    Lemongrass will need plenty of bright sunlight even in winter, so ensure it has access to natural light; otherwise, the stalks will turn brown.

                <p>
                    As a grassy plant, lemongrass needs a nitrogen-rich fertilizer for its best growth. <br>You can use a slow-release 6-4-0 fertilizer that will feed lemongrass throughout the growing season. <br>You can also water your lemongrass plants with manure tea, which will add trace nutrients.

                <p>
                    Your lemongrass plant needs to be watered regularly in order to maintain soil moisture. <br>Add some mulch over the soil to hold moisture.<br>You can also place your pots on top of a saucer with pebbles. <br>The stones will produce moisture for the soil.<br>
                    Watering daily is recommended. <br>Lemongrass thrives in moist soil, not soggy soil. <br>Make sure the pot you used has enough draining holes in them to prevent boggy soils.
