                    The capacity of the container can be anywhere from 0.5 litres (for indoor household plants) to 10 litres (for general garden use).<br>                    
                    It is usually made of metal, ceramic or plastic.<br>
                    At the end of the spout, a "rose" (a device, like a cap, with small holes) can be placed to break up the stream of water into droplets, to avoid excessive water pressure on the soil or on delicate plants.
