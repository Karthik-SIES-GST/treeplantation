                    These are the most common and inexpensive gloves.<br>
                    They are usually made from knit jersey or cotton and are machine washable.<br>
                    Their main purpose is to keep hands clean and they offer very little protection to the hands, but they are cooler and breathable.

                <p>
                    These are the best gloves for protecting hands while using chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides and fungicides.<br>
                    However, hands can get pretty hot and sweaty in them, and if you have a latex allergy you should avoid them.

                <p>
                    These gloves are made from a synthetic rubber material so they can protect hands from chemicals and cuts and scrapes.<br>
                    They are also made to be breathable and flexible.<br>
                    However, nasty thorns can still puncture through them.
